Description: Khronos official Vulkan ICD desktop loader for Linux
 The ICD loader is a library that is placed between a Vulkan application and any
 number of Vulkan drivers, in order to support multiple drivers and the
 instance-level functionality that works across these drivers. Additionally, the
 loader manages inserting Vulkan layer libraries, such as validation layers,
 between an application and the drivers.
